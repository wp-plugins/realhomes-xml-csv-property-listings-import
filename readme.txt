Easily import property listings from any XML or CSV file to the RealHomes theme with the RealHomes Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The RealHomes Add-On for [WP All Import](http://www.wpallimport.com/order-now/?utm_source=free-plugin&utm_medium=dot-org&utm_campaign=realhomes) makes it easy to bulk import your property listings to the RealHomes theme in less than 10 minutes.

The left side of the plugin looks just like RealHomes, and the right side displays a property listing from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the RealHomes fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a property listing in RealHomes.

We have several other real estate add-ons available, each specific to a different theme. This is a walkthrough of the Realia Add-On, which is very similar to the RealHomes Add-On.

= Why you should use the RealHomes Add-On for WP All Import =

* Instead of using the Custom Fields section of WP All Import, you are shown the fields like Property Address, Price, etc. in plain English.

* Automatically find the property location using either the property address or the latitude and longitude.

* Import property features, type, city and status to RealHomes' property search dropdowns.

* Link your imported properties to their real estate agent. If they don’t exist yet new agents will be created.

* Easily import gallery images, property attachments, sliders, and property videos.

* Supports files in any format and structure. There are no requirements that the data in your file be organized in a certain way. RealHomes CSV imports are easy, no matter the structure of your file. RealHomes XML imports are flexible and work with any XML file.

* Supports files of practically unlimited size by automatically splitting them into chunks. WP All Import is limited solely by your server settings.
